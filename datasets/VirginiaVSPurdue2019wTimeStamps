did last night when they played North
00:16
Carolina they are on a mission they're
00:18
shooting the ball better so Clark what
00:19
do you think I'm going Cavaliers because
00:21
of defense and improved offense all
00:24
right ray hunter will be in the middle
00:25
of it all one spot is set either Purdue
00:27

as you said they play so slow they have
02:44
the best story
02:48

Region final let the madness continue
04:10
tonight from Louisville Kentucky what a
04:13
scene here what a crowd
04:16
and we are just about ready to get this
04:18
one started
04:19
Allie LaForce was a scorer in college
04:21
but she's talking defense here tonight
04:23
benefit in the Cavaliers Christmas
04:27
Virginia defense has made a name for
04:28
itself because of its pack line defense
04:30
stifling some of the best offenses in
04:33
the nation all season long holding them
04:34
to 38% from the field but what is a pack
04:38
line defense
04:40
it's a half-court defense that packs in
04:42
the paint making it difficult to score
04:44
inside basically everybody but the
04:46
player guarding the ball has to be in an
04:48
imaginary zone that starts with a line
04:50
16 feet from the basket now to engrain
04:53
this area inside the players head
04:54
Virginia tapes down the area lock in
04:57
practice and every player must have a
04:58
foot inside the line at all times now
05:01
the pack pine is also a mentality
05:02
players will tell you the rotations in
05:05
the communication to work and move as a
05:06
unit for 40 minutes is very challenging
05:09
to beat it you have to knock down threes
05:11
this is a pretty team that's knocking
05:14
down just under 10
05:15
coming up again where they hit 15 which
05:18
style is going to get the web which
05:20
style is going to get Brian
05:22
there's so many high school coaches at
05:24
home fit you know about that pack line
05:26
you know about that sale drew watch this
05:28
export of defense tonight by Virginia
05:30
decorated players in these starting
05:32
fives Carson Edwards top scorer in the

05:58
Disney on the ground this excited the
06:00
whole crowd was standing up and I'm just
06:02
like wait a minute everyone in this
06:03
arena standing on their feet
06:05
well you played in games like this as a
06:08
player how do you come down from that
06:11
high of the introductions and try to get
06:13
into what you normally do try to do the
06:15
little
06:24
against Tennessee
06:26
he hits terrible
06:28
last five minutes that either tied the
06:31
game or gave Perdue the lead and who
06:33
else would hit the first shot of this
06:36
one
06:37
Ryan Klein the 6'5 senior from Carmel
06:40
Indiana
06:46
and the tub cookies good-natured took
06:49
the flop wasn't rewarded
06:51
and Virginia their first points on the
06:53
board
06:54
another way PA to get in your comfort
06:56
zone after all the hype and the energy
06:58
of the game to
06:59
little things if you're a big fella box
07:01
outrebound set strong screens go back to
07:04
the basics and then you'll calm down as
07:06
the game goes along
07:07
we are 500 miles from Charlotte's ville
07:09
here in Louisville we are 200 miles from
07:12
West Lafayette about a half hour drive
07:16
at seven foot three inches he is a beast
07:20
in the middle and he's got some finesse
07:22
as well
07:24
his first bucket of the day the deer
07:26
he'd say how strongly his hogs put his
07:28
shoulder into the chest the daka got a
07:30
little bit of space there and he got to
07:32
like that stock for hard to do Purdue
07:34
favor
07:34
[Applause]
07:43
score as well tied to Rome come on out
07:46
13 points played all but one minute as a
07:48
matter of fact these Virginia starters
07:50
played most of the game
07:53
on Thursday of their victory against
07:55
Oregon all the 12 minutes the starters
08:01
that works already with three balls in
08:06
offensively for Virginia the first two
08:09
offensive players in the game Purdue has
08:11
tried to take a charge it has been
08:13
unsuccessful but you need to make sure
08:14
you gather your feet because they made
08:16
that a point of emphasis in tonight's
08:18
game to try to to try to draw one when
08:20
he opens it took Purdue 99 points to an
08:24
overtime game against Tennessee Virginia
08:27
won with just 53 points against Oregon
08:30
and again @c ake EJ gets loose inside or
08:34
he is really emerging Cris the junior
08:36
from Guinea at 6-9 mama de ikita taking
08:40
over in the starting lineup for Jack
08:42
Shaw high for the little slow on the
08:44
rotation that time I'm sure the game
08:45
progresses he coaches them to make sure
08:47
that he gets over them to help defense
08:48
to stop that path to the cutter
08:51
Edward took it
09:02
thing about Maine Virginia if you get up
09:04
on it
09:08
to maybe watch their offense a little
09:10
bit
09:11
that's the only strategy you can go with
09:13
playing against Virginia
09:20
the enemy
09:22
[Applause]
09:24
this is going to be a three-point
09:27
shooting game here between guy and climb
09:30
they were AAU teammates in the
09:32
Indianapolis area rival high school
09:35
players that was a long - it was scored
09:38
from guy here's that word to get number
09:41
three no his first medicine guy rich
09:44
down the rebound
09:49
Virginia has been successful already the
09:51
two plays off of the pick and roll
09:53
finding the rollin with the slow
09:54
rotation defensively of Purdue let's see
09:57
if that's their style tonight to try to
09:59
get their triggers and facilitators
10:01
freak off a big girls run he and Clark
10:06
runs the pointer all will handle the
10:09
ball most of the time for Virginia not
10:13
shot and it's Edwards
10:15
lost the handle
10:17
tonight credits I traded commits the
10:19
foul can't fault the effort but it was
10:25
to the boiler to have a Carson Edwards
10:28
in the thirties off to see doctor tell
10:30
you what he's produced of all-time
10:31
leader in points scored in the NCAA
10:34
tournament that means he could shoot
10:36
them
10:41
here's a look at the overeats tournament
10:44
summary the Red Raiders of Texas Tech
10:47
out of the big 12 headed to the final
10:49
floor Purdue's hoping to make it to the
10:50
Final Four for the first time since 1980
10:53
last time they were at elite 8 game was
10:55
in the Jean Katie days and there is Tony
10:58
Bennett back in an elite 8 game for the
11:01
second time 13 and 8 record in the NCAA
11:06
tournament but he has not been to a
11:09
Final Four as a head coach his father
11:11
dick made it to a Final Four with the
11:14
Wisconsin Badgers so that is the
11:18
legacies that we want gkt we passed it
11:20
down to Matt painter and the father and
11:23
son legacy of the Bennett's in the
11:25
corner coming out of the timeout not
11:27
their rebound
11:28
ripped out by hunter at deep
11:30
[Applause]
11:35
never have a stop in the possession to e
11:37
sin with the rebound that time for do
11:39
they're gonna have to rebound tonight by
11:41
committee you can't just leave it up to
11:43
harm you just can't leave it up to
11:45
wheeler everybody has to get in there
11:47
and box up mama de ikita has a quick six
11:50
inside to harms cutting is no gently
11:53
stir denied by the Akita it's got the
11:55
pack
11:56
God pushes it time to run quick three is
11:59
up I thought you said they played slow
12:02
VFL there there there okay is this baby
12:04
there person that they like it when you
12:06
have scores you can definitely switch
12:07
again crash there
12:09
on the floor for the firm
12:10
are they able to hit the three horns
12:13
taps it right to Clark I think both
12:16
coaches feel like they can play at any
12:19
pace Virginia would like to slow the
12:21
pace they planned the slowest pace in
12:23
the analytic world in college basketball
12:26
but they're more comfortable with their
12:28
new styles of offense
12:29
flying at a quicker pace and certainly
12:31
Purdue is comfortable going fast and
12:34
high scoring games and low scoring
12:36
Affairs as much work misses badly
12:39
that's how you change the comfort zone a
12:41
Virginia you make them play down it's
12:43
easy to play slow and methodical with
12:45
your uh ball game to win you down that's
12:47
when God start to press it a little bit
12:49
and come a little out of character and
12:50
for Purdue that's what you want to try
12:52
to force the salt up not many teams have
12:54
done it to Virginia
12:54
[Applause]
12:56
fine and Edwards the two deadly
12:58
three-point shooters for producing
13:00
Easter's left from there shot clock down
13:04
to four climb he
13:08
here in this guy but I am flying he's
13:11
hit a pair already
13:14
that hits BA
13:16
look like his shot always
13:18
but that hitch to the head takes it back
13:20
another level when the shot-blocker
13:21
can't get there he can just kind of
13:23
swing it up over there
13:25
unorthodox up but tell you what it's
13:27
beautiful when he goes in the mechanics
13:29
of a fly-fishermen his coach says but it
13:32
works inside the Andre puncher strong to
13:36
the basket he's on the wooden watch list
13:40
he's a first-team all-acc performer this
13:43
year injured in the tournament last year
13:46
was hurt had a wrist injury and that
13:50
dramatic upset the 16 over the 1 UMBC
13:52
over Virginia the Cavs have been able to
13:55
erase that when this sees now thought to
13:58
get an idea Keating he is
14:00
place recovery how did he get back in
14:03
the plane we talked about the best
14:04
defense in the countries because of the
14:06
pressure of the guards and the passing
14:07
lanes and then the big fellas inside the
14:10
Akita his second block
14:13
tied to Rome to hunter for three let it
14:17
slide and clears it away
14:20
you can still take bad shots in a slow
14:23
methodical pace smoke that still was a
14:26
bad shot that team which they probably
14:27
would have had that position back
14:29
hundred he could knock it down but just
14:30
seemed like that was a rush play for
14:32
Virginia
14:33
[Applause]
14:41
come around the corner guy is autumn
14:44
- gotta get one up wheeler does
14:51
they popped the whistle to take a look
14:57
it was close
15:05
climb the unorthodox shot look at the
15:08
hitch look at the cock back banging
15:12
knock down in here let's see if it was
15:13
on time he gets it out of his hands I
15:15
think so but I'm not sure I'll tell you
15:18
what that's patience in an office if
15:20
it's a great defense like Virginia say
15:22
these freshmen for Purdue clearly behind
15:24
the line did he get it off in time is
15:27
the question remember normally in the
15:30
rule book you would go by the sound of
15:32
the horn there is no chance of this it
15:36
is the zero on the clock a bump the
15:40
backboard so it hits zero can it be
15:44
closer than that on hand we're going
15:47
into the coaching toggle right now looks
15:52
like his hand is still on it if that's
15:54
the last frame well here's what's
15:56
important now it was scored as good it
16:00
was scored on the court as off in time
16:03
is there enough evidence to overturn
16:05
here is the major question and they do
16:09
they wave it off shot clock violation
16:11
[Applause]
16:19
have some good teamwork right there by
16:21
the officials way to get together let's
16:24
bring in jean stare at or what you see
16:25
there Jean see web I couldn't agree with
16:28
you more it's a great job by the
16:30
officials and let's remember because
16:32
this shot was successful that's what
16:35
allows the officials to go look it up
16:37
potential shot clock violation if it
16:39
were unsuccessful they couldn't go one
16:41
way or the other but because it goes in
16:43
they look after looking at the replay
16:45
it's just on his fingertips and they do
16:47
the correct thing and take that shot
16:49
away great summary of their Jean
16:51
appreciate Jean being for this all March
16:53
Madness he's been outstanding giving you
16:55
a great perspective he'll be with you
16:57
throughout the final four in the
16:59
championship game so it is a shot clock
17:02
violation and opportunity the block guy
17:05
sneaks it but can't score between
17:09
bring in salt for Virginia got a little
17:12
more muscle inside and pape also bring
17:13
in will you're just going to be a lot of
17:15
banging down there in the paint for
17:17
those two big guys trying to hold it
17:18
down for the team Jack saw the redshirt
17:22
senior now in its fifth year in the
17:23
program against the freshman traviata'
17:25
million to go on a skill offensively
17:28
comes up short we learn that captain
17:30
hunter the freshman
17:37
dude get in Virginia a little bit of
17:39
their own medicine on the boards right
17:42
now
17:42
Virginia with two offensive rebounds one
17:45
for the do with that big one turned it
17:47
to a three-pointer
17:48
the freshmen for Purdue have been
17:52
nothing short of tremendous in this
17:54
tournament he gets lying in his words on
17:56
the floor with him
18:02
pushing it time now he'll get it back to
18:05
Eric hunter Junior
18:08
Hunter Williams wheeler to give his Matt
18:11
painter some great minutes there's a
18:12
foul Edwards was hit on the forearm free
18:17
throws when we come back
18:19
[Applause]
18:26
Perdue by five in a reminder you can get
18:29
complete coverage of the NCAA Division
18:31
one women's tournament on ncaa.com
18:35
and let's take a look at the Progressive
18:37
Insurance first half game summary purdue
18:39
already at it again 45 may threes in
18:44
this tournament through three plus games
18:46
they've hit 5 of 7
18:47
Virginia is Oak before it was Kyle guy
18:51
who hit a long 2 for the Hoos
18:55
and now Carson Edwards at the free-throw
18:57
line
18:58
Chris he is averaged over 10 free-throw
19:02
attempts per game in the city CAA
19:04
tournament 32 free-throw attempts that
19:07
was number 33 that was 26 for 33 yeah
19:10
and gets to the Rocky what you love
19:13
about that BA he doesn't settle this
19:14
shows that he gives you a little bit of
19:16
everything in his bag and you've seen
19:18
Kline knocking down about this kleiner
19:20
net was became the fourth pair of
19:22
teammates in NCAA history that each have
19:24
25 points and 5 made 3 so I think we
19:27
should expect a lot more from both of
19:28
them as the game goes on nobody in the
19:30
big 10 has ever made more threes in a
19:32
season than Carson Ed works as he hits a
19:34
couple of free throws in two free throws
19:37
to tie the game and force overtime
19:40
against Tennessee
19:42
seven point per doodly Virginia and
19:45
Braxton key airball hunter
19:52
deandre hunter had the rebound Eric
19:55
hunter stole it away from them
19:59
gives up that traffic it is whoops I
20:04
mean come on look at the play of Hunter
20:07
junior first of all on the other man he
20:09
gets to strip and write on this in he
20:11
doesn't reach which is the bane of
20:13
existence for all coaches reaching in
20:15
the back court he stand he just stands
20:18
there there was a little stunt the
20:20
turnover for the carry mama de ikita
20:22
back in Roxton key will set mojo Eastern
20:26
returns for Purdue extend first team
20:32
all-defensive team no gel Eastern he's
20:36
usually the one that gets the offense
20:38
initiated and it usually finds the hands
20:42
of Carson Edwards highest usage in
20:45
college basketball this year Edwards
20:47
[Music]
20:49
Perdue setting some great flare screens
20:51
his wheeler
20:55
arriving at just the right time the
20:58
questioning
21:00
makers
21:04
you want to see who Virginia is we know
21:06
that stats we know that they play the
21:08
slowest in the country how do you
21:10
continue when you have a team that
21:12
scored to do right now for at 11:01 turn
21:15
Virginia get it back heels get to stroke
21:18
the Akita up there
21:20
and in his salt who gives it to God
21:22
[Applause]
21:24
that was smart
21:26
I could feel Edwards on his back and
21:28
draws the foul he'll shoot three
21:31
[Applause]
21:37
now cook is introducing new
21:39

Brian Anderson Chris Webber Allen the
21:48
force
21:52
directing
21:57
to number one seeds already eliminated
22:01
clearly behind the line with the contact
22:05
so two more free throws poor guy
22:08
yeah I hear you on him filming the
22:10
defense behind but I there's not too
22:12
many players in the country that have a
22:14
green light like God so whether he was
22:16
filling the presents or not he's gonna
22:18
let it fly cuz he knows he can knock it
22:20
down so
22:22
confident shoes guy shoots little over
22:25
seven threes a game on average he is a
22:27
career 43% three-point shooter so they
22:31
agreed his neon
22:33
really struggled shooting two three in
22:35
his NCAA tournament career at one point
22:37
it missed 17 in a row until he banged a
22:40
couple in the second half against Oregon
22:43
watched the slip for the bit meet inside
22:45
to sit in the streets
22:46
Wheeler's talked about the feel of it
22:47
that comes up short and big Jack saw the
22:50
New Zealand to rip sit down to the
22:52
rebound like to see Virginia be a little
22:55
more patient in their office I don't
22:57
like some of the shots they've been
22:58
getting and when their deliberate taking
22:59
their time is so hard to stop
23:01
[Applause]
23:04
the Akita working on wheeler shot flake
23:08
and gets the pretty room mamma dee dee
23:10
acute a got off to a great start with
23:13
eight points
23:13
that's the patience that she want he
23:15
took his time in the dribble who saw
23:16
shooters kind of getting their space in
23:19

23:21
back to me in patient Virginia
23:22
basketball
23:30

23:37
parson Edwards Allred
23:43

23:51
trying to hook the Andre hunter will be
23:54
called to the foul Wow the lead a what a
23:57
matchup Conference champions in the
23:59
regular season battling for a trip to
24:01
the Final Four
24:08
this is just my hair how do I look
24:11
I look good it's everything people from
24:14
here don't really get it might be
24:15
European thing I really like it a lot of
24:17
people don't I hit the guy with the hair
24:19
people say Ivan Drago people say
24:21
Morrissey you like I won't do this
24:23
anymore I see people hate it when I
24:24
touch it Ivan Drago it gets a lot of
24:28
attention to everybody the bad from
24:32
Amsterdam Matt harms seven foot three
24:35
inch sophomore at his game just
24:39
continues to evolve at eleven and six
24:41
against Tennessee in the sweet 16
24:43
matchup
24:44
Ali has more on the harms hair what do
24:47
you have Ali love talking to Matt about
24:49
this because he gets really animated
24:50
he's like what do you want me to do I
24:52
have cool hair I mean he touches it so
24:54
much but he goes it gets in my face
24:55
that's what I have to do so coach
24:57
painter said if you get twenty boards in
24:59
a game you can wear a headband
25:01
[Music]
25:01
[Applause]
25:04
so Virginia's gone down they scored a
25:06
couple of basket baskets in the last two
25:08
possessions after a five-minute
25:10
right without a basket and it's 25 to 19
25:14
Virginia's a very difficult team to run
25:17
away from they only lost three games all
25:20
year folks 2 episode conference play is
25:22
Edward's misses just a second miss
25:27
barson Edwards is three for five from
25:30
behind the arc already with 11 points
25:32
Clyde is hit two threes he hey Clark
25:36
back on the floor Edwards checks him
25:39
Jerome gives him right back
25:43
Sasha Stefanovic on to Rome first
25:47
minutes for Stefanovic and I trip rips
25:49
down the board
25:52
plus four it's tough shots great play
25:54
right there defensively but if you're
25:57
Purdue you want to make sure you stay in
25:58
the passing lanes and offensive you
26:00
execute because you have Virginia right
26:02
now kind of reeling on their heels not
26:03
clean but the covers only usually have
26:05
Edwards have fall knocked out of his
26:07
hands so no travel now
26:10
he thought it was a clean Peck
26:13
but to roll who
26:15
is a premium defender in his own right
26:18
got him across the chest this is what I
26:22
mean about Virginia they're really not
26:23
known for filing and so already the
26:25
course the game has just started but if
26:27
you are a boilermaker you're saying we
26:29
were kind of sticking to the game plan
26:31
not allowing them to just play teams to
26:34
play us like they do other teams just
26:36
the second Virginia fouled by Kurt's
26:37
gonna pull a three
26:40
that's last touch my guy that was
26:43
and his hair that kept that one alive I
26:46
think he got some product in there or no
26:48
cause he has to wipe this hair all the
26:49
time but as we see it this is why you
26:51
stay in the plane this is why you'd
26:53
never give up on the play because it's
26:54
not about you getting the rebound this
26:56
is about you hopefully forcing that ball
26:57
also off of another man's hands if you
27:00
don't have position Carson AdWords will
27:04
set he played the entire game 45 minutes
27:08
against Tennessee matter of fact he's
27:10
played at Isabella foul he hey Clark
27:15
fouls stefanov it's that Carson Edwards
27:21
hasn't played all the 38 seconds during
27:24
this year's NCAA tournament clear foul
27:27
Clark will head to the bench he hey
27:33
Clark picks up his second foul the third
27:36
team foul there's only been six fouls
27:39
thus far with six and a half to go in
27:43
this first half the old Clark can let it
27:46
fly other night
27:48
courts tend to take the shots he knocked
27:50
em down Purdue was decided to do it
27:52
differently
27:53
trapping judiciously but really getting
27:56
back forcing long shots packing the pain
28:03
the offense come from without Edwards on
28:05
the floor and arms turns it over
28:09
those are the possessions you cannot
28:11
give up to a Virginia team you must get
28:14
a shot off against the defense or really
28:17
your shot selection is your defense
28:19
because now you allow it to be a
28:21
four-point swing if Virginia could
28:23
commit Virginia cut it off there's a
28:25
nine ACC title they won the regular
28:28
season shared it with North Carolina
28:31
that'd be much Lorna stay to the ACC
28:34
tournament to rob the low flow
28:35
it comes climb for new wants to push and
28:39
Virginia gets back and here's climb it
28:41
doesn't matter that's a quick three
28:42
harms and it's going to stay in the
28:45
possession of Perdue once again harms I
28:47
think beau barosky saw it differently
28:49
and the officials come together
28:54
in the hands of Tony Bennett's calves
28:57
[Applause]
29:01
look like the resolve of Virginia there
29:04
it seems like they may have had the call
29:05
right first the bangbang plays that's
29:08
what he want to make sure you gang
29:09
rebound so but you don't allow the
29:11
official to make a call because she's
29:12
secured the border
29:17
cursive Edwards back on the floor he got
29:20
a full 45 seconds rest that's enough do
29:23
Pesci that was more time often he'd had
29:26
the entire tournament leading us to this
29:27
game he has been a workhorse shot clock
29:32
down to none Virginia very comfortable
29:34
in the league clock scenario Jax saw
29:36
with the left hands there's a guy who
29:40
could be a key in this game Jack saw
29:46
the charts for Purdue huh 40 141
29:53
here's climbed another one is self last
29:57

30:48

30:50
the events
30:53
back on the floor his head works now
30:55
cuts it Edwards little bit range it's
30:57
good that's good I mean he split the
31:00
ball while he was catching it it wasn't
31:02
off the dribble his quickness is amazing
31:05
it he continually reminds me man of a
31:09
young Derrick Rose at Memphis how strong
31:12
huh how strong and just his leverage
31:15
getting to the bump stops of eight Oh
31:17
Virginia run and the odd dream hunter
31:20
answers with a little mid-range of his
31:22
own under second made field goal

diandra hunter averaging 15.2 points per
31:31

tippers
33:21

33:24
with the shots the difficulty on each
33:26
shot
33:28
he is hot as he is knocking him down it
33:30
just when you forget about him seems

doubtful deep is worth
33:36
five has six of those 14 by the rest of
33:40

33:46
comes away with it
33:47
hip-fire a 3-0 pulls down the board
33:53
Perdue is getting some looks from behind
33:55
the art there now 8 for 17 from
33:57
three-point range
33:59
17 3-point attempts already and the best
34:03
defensive team in the nation
34:05
protecting the 3-point arc the Virginia
34:08
Cavaliers
34:09
[Applause]
34:14
Gammage saw nothing there D a--quite a
34:16
4-3 miss badly
34:20
great defense by Williams that time
34:21
because he went down and doubled he
34:23
forced me to keep say to take the
34:24
tuckshop and that's what Purdue is doing
34:26
they are not led to she does she and guy
34:28
just went down and it looks like he hurt
34:30
his right foot or ankle in his team
34:33
doesn't see her and then finally the
34:35
whistle blows here gone down in a heap
34:38
[Applause]
34:42
so Tony Bennett sees his first team
34:49
all-acc performer and Kyle guy down the
34:54
winding in pain pops up quickly let's
34:57
see we can follow ya right there so it
34:58
gets tangled up there with Eric hunter
35:00
jr. and rolls the right ankle ethan's to
35:06
leave a long time athletic trainer for
35:08
the Virginia Cavaliers will do all he
35:11
can to try to ease the discomfort of
35:15
Kyle guy say the longer he sits it we're
35:17
just 209 from halftime that is going to
35:21
be a headline when we start the second
35:23
half
35:23
bottom right of your screen here oh yeah
35:26
stuff going to look like he made him
35:28
twisted and if you're Purdue you can't
35:30
fall asleep or be happy the guy is on
35:32
the side because Clark is hearing we saw
35:35
what Kihei can do he can score but right
35:38
now who stand up facilitator but such a
35:41
tough point guard always keeps his team
35:43
in the game
35:44
six one four six from the field open
35:46
three from three
35:50
under 2-minutes to go in a whistle and
35:54
see who this belongs to
35:56
Ryan Klein perhaps yep trying to get the
35:58
call guy already has the shoe off and
36:04
the athletic trainer
36:05
Ethan Saliba is currently in a rewrapped
36:09
trying to get him back on the floor as
36:11
fast as he can they don't even bother
36:12
going back to the locks DK missed the
36:15
dunk gets up and softness is but a foul
36:17
on Jimmy on Williams good action by the
36:20
Virginia bigs de ikita and salt defended

36:35
half Greg Clark Killian Charles first

36:44

36:47
has been the battery in this produced
36:50

36:55
it be good wheeler with the great play
37:02
salt
37:04
my sister Purdue on
37:06
that just shows you how they've been
37:07
moving the ball around tonight not a lot
37:10
of one-on-one shots but they wanted
37:11
shots coming within the boffins assisted
37:14
by a teammate and his hunter of checks
37:17
Edwards now blocking foul on DeAndre
37:20
hunter at Tony Bennett is stopping man

[Applause]
37:29

the inbounds keeps it alive into the
37:44
hands of de ikita
37:46
three-point game Virginia down with the
37:49

37:56
base large screens being set for him
37:57
also salt inside the Akita
38:00
[Applause]

38:13
from Kia Clark don't go to a park right

38:19
Harvard
38:20
of Purdue that his eyes too

he said sikes pulled me back it makes it
38:26
much chuckle 13:5 virginia run Purdue

38:40

38:45
Tiki day with a board
38:48

38:56
to the halftime locker room
38:59
[Applause]
39:10
punter right with Jerome
39:15
canto jr. fouls tied to Rome with 1.2 on
39:19
the gay club look at Clark's eyes right
39:24
there
39:24
you made everyone think he was gonna go
39:26
for the shot then this play right here
39:29
the last two calls I don't necessarily
39:30
agree with them a little physical but
39:32
that's what you want to be denying but
39:34
you do the right thing you attack when
39:37
it's too much pressure with the referee
39:39
in a tough position hopefully you get
39:40
the call to go in office
39:45
AT&T; takes us above the rim one of the
39:48
best plays of the night mama Dee Dee a
39:52
keychain with the SWAT a couple of
39:55
blocks already all right Chris so that
39:57
was a foul on hunter Iowa a rather
40:01
Purdue I beg your pardon had a foul to
40:02
give till to be side out for Virginia
40:05
we'll see what the setup comes in that
40:07
block did you talk about the forced
40:10
talked earlier about that pack zone and
40:12
he was in that pack zone coming over to
40:15
helping Virginia's been doing a great
40:17
job of that that's how they've gotten
40:18
back into the game patience on offense
40:20
getting back into their defensive
40:22
principles namely the pack zone and
40:24
right now you have to watch out for the
40:27
guy with the hops out there that's
40:28
number 30 huh he can go to the hole hope
40:31
hope for
40:33
and watch the guy kicking for the shop
40:34
now guy back on the floor reach a
40:37
banquet his deity cake and that will
40:41
take us to the end of the first half
40:45
my boy Carson Edward goes 416 form a
40:50
threes in the first half he had a couple
40:52
of free throws as well and matched
40:54
Anders Boilermakers up a points as we
40:58
hit the half and let's send it to out in
41:01
the four shoots with the Big Ten Coach
41:03
of the Year do you put your team in a
41:05
position to knock down all of those
41:07
threes in that first half yeah well I
41:09
thought we had some good threes that we
41:10
missed too so it's hard to get a good
41:12
look against them so whether it's early
41:14
in the shot clock or late in the shot
41:16
clock you got to take your rhythm shots
41:18
for most of that half Virginia had to
41:19
settle for contested jumpers how do you
41:21
keep them uncomfortable on offense well
41:23
I think first of all you got to be able
41:25
to contain the treble when they broke us
41:26
down there that came off some curls got
41:28
into the middle of the lane we got to do
41:29
a better job of staying with them but
41:31
more importantly got to stay with those
41:32
shooters Thank You pence all right
41:34
thanks Perdue led by 18 in the sweet 16
41:38
game against Tennessee had to go to
41:40
overtime to win it they were up 10
41:42
tonight up a point as we go to the half
41:45
AT&T; at the half after these messages
41:48
[Music]
41:52
you
41:57
this is AT&T; at the half
42:00
AT&T; giving you more for your March
42:03
Madness thing first 20 minutes gone by
42:08
in Louisville
42:09
Purdue trying to make a Big Ten entry
42:12
into the Final Four
42:13
and Virginia the number one seed
42:15
standing in their way welcome back
42:16
everyone 32:29 Boilermakers in the lead
42:19
here in New York with AT&T; at the half
42:20
I'm Greg Gumbel along with Clark Kenny
42:22
and Charles not a lot to choose from
42:24
between these two teams over the first
42:26
20 minutes although Purdue frittered
42:28
away a ten-point lead they did actually
42:30
it was kind of a crock-pot comeback by
42:33
Virginia you slaughter pot crock-pot
42:35
just similar similar yeah was it wasn't
42:37
a fast cook they just kind of milked
42:38
their way and they did it by getting
42:40
inside
42:41
Mamadou mom mama D be a key take getting
42:45
it done he had ten points to lead the
42:47
Cavaliers in that first half here's
42:49
DeAndre hunter he had four but again
42:51
points in the paint 14 to two in favor
42:54
of Virginia second-chance points plus
42:56
four that overcame the eight threes that
43:00
Purdue was able to make in that first or
43:02
do got to start to the game that they
43:03
wanted got the start to the game you
43:05
know and I watch it cause a net was over
43:07
like I said over the summer and into
43:08
this season right now sighs would one
43:13
thing I would try on him quickness in
43:15
size but when you put somebody who has
43:17
the agility or the same size them I
43:20
think he's just a better basketball
43:21
player because it's like shooting over a
43:23
chair and for him in the first half
43:25
that's what I was looking at in Kenney
43:27
vision I think overall just the the
43:30
ability to just come off this screen and
43:32
I don't care how great a player mr.
43:36
Clark is he's not big enough to defend
43:39
this and the same way here when even
43:41
when he cuts it out here because the net
43:43
which gets it he can size them up and I
43:45
could see the rim bucket and then this
43:47
last plate is just my main man Aaron
43:50
will adjust because I known him since he
43:52
was like three years old two years old
43:53
so I just had to get him in the
43:55
highlights because he had his three his
43:56
dad and I played against each other in
43:59
high school and I'm so proud of Aaron
44:01
and they're like shooting over a chair
44:02
shooting over a chair that s was the
44:04
phrase we use quite often a parent in
44:07
basketball circles you know I say before
44:09
the game
44:10
Carson had to get 30 he's on pace for 30
44:13
to me he's the only player on that team
44:15
no disrespect to mr. Klein who had a
44:17
fantastic last game as good as
44:19
defensively Virginia is I don't think
44:22
per Duke and scored enough less cars and
44:24
goes crazy for 30 but Virginia played
44:27
very well my guy cow guy he is 1 for 6
44:30
Oh for 3 he played he's been in a slump
44:32
pretty much the whole term in fairness
44:34
mm-hmm but I think if I'm Virginia I
44:37
feel pretty good they made eight for the
44:39
1930s I don't think they can
44:41
consistently shoot that in the second
44:43
half
44:43
I still like Virginia all right right
44:45
now it's a one-point game 32:29 one team
44:49
already has a seat in minneapolis West
44:51
Regional final Texas Tech and Gonzaga
44:53
Davide Moretti
44:55
he was so clutch down the stretch that
44:57
was a big one there basically put the
45:00
comfort zone on it for Texas Tech great
45:02
block here but you see there tarik Owens
45:05
was out of bounds when he retrieved that
45:07
ball that should have been Gonzaga ball
45:09
that is not a reviewable play so we
45:11
played on the diggeth distillery I had
45:14
got the pilfer and then Josh Perkins
45:16
stepped into a three but a good look for
45:19
kis perk and at the end of the day made
45:22
free throws down the stretch here's a
45:24
reach-in over the base line that is
45:26
deemed a technical foul that was called
45:29
which allowed Texas Tech to select their
45:32
shooter it was Moretti he calmly knocked
45:35
down a pair of free throws that also led
45:37
to ball possession being retained by
45:40
Texas Tech there and you see the
45:42
emotional contrast between the Raiders
45:46
and the zags there one on to the final
45:49
four and a great season comes to an end
45:51
for the Gonzaga Bulldogs kenny chuck i
45:54
thought the red raiders showed a lot of
45:55
character against a very good Gonzaga
45:57
team oh you know what they showed great
45:59
defense slowed down great offense just
46:01
enough mm-hm
46:02
you know it's always that contrast yet
46:04
the best offensive team against the best
46:07
offensive team and we said could Texas
46:09
Tech scored enough points and bring them
46:12
back down to the pack it was a perfect
46:14
scenario they made every play down the
46:16
stretch but today great defense
46:18
beat great offense it's funny because
46:20
I've watched three in the entirety of
46:23
Gonzaga's losses I've seen three in the
46:26
entirety and each one were different
46:28
each key was different so Texas Tech the
46:31
way they play did not play the same way
46:33
when North Carolina beat them so I'm not
46:36
really sure what style will get them but
46:39
today I thought that length
46:41
I thought the athleticism on key moments
46:44
was the difference but every loss that
46:46
I've seen any entirety they lost
46:48
different ways
46:49
Texas Tech won at seventy five sixty
46:51
nine Gonzaga on their way home
46:53
Texas Tech on their way to Minneapolis
46:55
will take timeout here back with more on
46:57

way back when I woke up what do you got
50:02
opening night I mean obviously the
50:05
graphic room mess with those guys with
50:06
the push-ups that's fun but the opening
50:09
night when you have the gamut of
50:11
everybody opening up and everyone with
50:13
the expectation that they could be
50:14
Cinderella or they could be the King CK
50:16
that's it my man's Charles Barkley
50:18
seeing his alma mater my favorites Baker
50:24

51:31
apex legends play now rated T for teen
51:35
and by Buick proud partner of the NCAA
51:45
just about ready for the second half as
51:47
you take a look at the lows first-half
51:49
stats Perdue come up firing from
51:52
three-point range but got cold quickly
51:54
Virginia climbing out of a ten-point
51:57
hole within a point Virginia head coach
52:00
Tony Bennett moments ago with Allie
52:02
LaForce coach we saw a guy into the
52:05
ankle before the half how limited if at
52:07
all will he be in a second he's okay
52:09
he's warming up there right now so we'll
52:10
get a quick feel Perdue did most of the
52:12
damage in the first 12 minutes you did
52:13
yours in the last day what was the
52:15
difference I mean they hit some tough
52:16
shots we just got to keep trying to
52:18
bother those shootings shooters we'll
52:19
start with some length with dray on
52:21
Edwards and then when they do miss we
52:23
got a limit them to one shot and get the
52:25
rebounds and then run our offense hard
52:26
Thank You coach it's good Intel there
52:29
from Tony Bennett so they start with
52:31
some length on Carson Edwards in DeAndre
52:34
hunter it was the bigs and the bench for
52:36
Virginia that helps them climb back out
52:37
of it here the big
52:39
and fourteen pain points they gives you
52:41
extra possession you see the three
52:43
switch stage the dynamics once they got
52:45
going inside Purdue only two points in
52:48
the paint are you kidding me but if
52:50
you're going to be two for 12 from
52:51
three-point land like Virginia you got a
52:53
dominate inside teams in the big ten
52:56
this year against Purdue when you tried
52:58
to slow down Carson Edwards you put size
53:01
on them the andre hunter at six seven
53:05
will try to cool off the hottest shooter
53:07
in the NCAA tournament in carson edwards
53:10
guy is on the floor to start the second
53:12
half he puts it in to Jerome and away we
53:15
go half number two a trip to the Final
53:17
Four
53:18
up for grabs would be the first Final
53:21
Four appearance for either of these
53:23
programs for the first time since the
53:25
80s 1984 for Virginia 1984 Purdue
53:33
to roll up with salt nothing there
53:35
here's guy gets up the first shot and
53:38
gets a three and a good sign for
53:41
Cavaliers fans that is their first lead
53:44
they trailed by 10 with nine minutes
53:47
left in the first half
53:50
doing their job knocking down the three
53:51
they were only two for 12 that was a big
53:53
we're not let's say if we do you can get
53:55
the ball inside the average 29 points
53:58
per game of the paint tonight
54:02
Jerome you got salt and deep heating on
54:06
the floor together Virginia got just 12
54:10
minutes out of their bench in their
54:12
sweet 16 victory over Oregon that's it
54:15
12 minutes salt played 12 minutes off
54:18
the bench in the first half and he
54:20
starts his second half his Jerome little
54:22
floater back iron at harms is fouled by
54:25
Jerome
54:26
[Applause]
54:29
ties her own picks up his second foul
54:32
though there's the man who sits with the
54:35
size on the floor key hey Clark the
54:39
smallest player on the floor typically
54:41
maybe the moon and maybe the scrap
54:43
because he has a lot of heart out there
54:45
but right now Virginia choosing to go at
54:48
size but you can bet your last dollar
54:51
Clark is gonna finish this game fly when
54:55
we step back salt is on inside the heart
54:58
say bye ether as he crashes into the
55:01
photographers
55:02
great effort by no jelly Stern stay in
55:06
the possession of Perdue there's nine on
55:08
the shot clock
55:09
we've seen there under the rim play
55:14
calling before you have to watch for a
55:16
screen I further every usually back
55:18
screens for harm we'll have an open lane
55:21
or whoever back screens may have a wide
55:24
open shot because the defense has to
55:26
guard
55:27
his Edwards Watson lost the handle steel
55:32
to DeAndre hunter
55:35
how the size effect Carson Edwards do
55:38
you think he could just blow by guys
55:39
yeah and actually he can but on that
55:41
time he lost his dribble with size
55:42
always felt especially when you gotta
55:44
got penetrated here's guy but again it
55:46
is two for two in the second half went
55:51
down with an ankle injury in the first
55:53
half came back to the last possession
55:55
and now is buried a couple of trays
56:00
great start for Virginia
56:04
Edwards with hunter autumn TM keychain
56:08
with the rebound
56:10
so far the move by Tony Bennett has paid
56:13
off it
56:14
to the second half yeah Purdue's gonna
56:16
have to play tough Big Ten basketball
56:18
because they're gonna have to shore up
56:20
the inside both with rebounding and
56:22
getting a couple of scores his side
56:24
climb he gains the foul right there but
56:27
God it hasn't been the most consistent
56:30
but it doesn't matter he's here now and
56:33
he's two for two in the second half from
56:35
beyond the arc he had been one for six
56:37
when he went down with the ankle injury
56:39
and so Purdue ball after the foul
56:43
two turnovers for the Hoos here in this
56:46
second half
56:47
Purdue's started this game seven for 10
56:51
from behind the arc they
56:53
they're lost ten songs doing a good job
56:57
in their own horn they can't get the
56:59
ball into his dojo eastern spring spring
57:01
gets my Jerome who's sitting that with
57:04
two fouls and an easy deuce for no
57:08
jellies tourney this was made from
57:10
Purdue get points in the paint there's
57:11
only their fourth point this second
57:13
bucket in the paint
57:14
all night long because Virginia has been
57:17
dominated inside by the way it's the
57:19
first points by a Purdue player other
57:20
than Carson Edwards since the 9:46 mark
57:23
of the first half that one is going to
57:25
go to Rome a chance at a three-point
57:28
play so silky smooth with the basketball
57:33
and that quick little floater he has
57:36
this is the patience at Virginia who
57:39
take your time no forcing a shot they
57:42
really didn't have assistant buckets in
57:44
the first half now though eight assists
57:46
on 15 field goals
57:47
that's Virginia's way to play they're
57:49
not one-on-one guys their system and
57:51
team oriented they need to get back to
57:53
their identity if they want to dominate
57:55
women's game Virginia
57:58
one matchup against gardner-webb a 16
58:00
seed remember they were down 14 in the
58:03
first half having to answer all those
58:05
questions about losing
58:06
you NBC the sixteenth seed last year
58:10
first time it ever happened in NCAA
58:12
tournament
58:14
to come back
58:17
irony of the first half here tonight
58:19
butter on Edwards shop pocket nine
58:22
Edwards trying to shake him
58:26
turn
58:26
[Applause]
58:32
do not settle for a three-point shot
58:34
Hunter has about a four inch five six
58:37
inch advantage over you therefore he's
58:39
gonna make it difficult for your jump
58:41
shots right now it's about getting into
58:43
the paint getting fouls over there big
58:45
guy trying to as a guard you can wear
58:47
down the big guys as well who filed
58:49
trouble and making them tentative not
58:51
one to block the shot trying to avoid
58:52
the five second foul on DeAndre hunter
58:55
here's the lefty arms saw two pulls down
58:59
the rebound
58:59
I think Virginia's a-okay with Horace
59:01
shooting threes only took 21 three-point
59:06
attempts the entire season seems like
59:10
maybe trade me on wings needs to come
59:12
back out here right now
59:13
I for trying to guard the Akita inside
59:15
nothing he can't garner but you still
59:17
gotta get offensive rebounds box out
59:19
just a lot of work for the guy the Akita
59:21
with eyford Auto patient and the Akita
59:25
know and it's harms balls on the floor
59:27
he comes Easter
59:29
to Eastern and cross over the lack
59:32
response
59:33
generally sir one of the premier
59:36
defenders of the big ten turns defense
59:38
into offense this is what he did the
59:41
other night Thursday night
59:45
the pace for Purdue because when he gets
59:46
to steal he's going all the way he's not
59:48
trying to slow it down
59:49
and set it up
59:55
Gayathri
60:00

[Music]

61:22
performance he had in that sweet 16 game
61:24
against Tennessee 27 points in 29
61:28
minutes it was a career-high for him so
61:33
Carson Edwards commits the foul his
61:35
third foul
61:37
that puts de ikita at the
61:39
four to 69% free-throw shooter first one
61:44

in this game with his one steal and
62:03
pound event mean just hounding that word
62:08

62:10

a point with Edwards a clutch free-throw
80:48
shooter at the line so smart by Edwards

anymore so he didn't have to use his
80:56
moves to get a step back
80:58
Clark is on him and yes Edwards has been
81:00
penetrated but he will get a treat a lot
81:03
more with Clark warning that he had the
81:05
size advantage
81:06
knocks down the first day 84 percent

83:48
Purdue defense he a key chain with the
83:49
offensive board
83:51
but another 30 on the shot clock that
83:54
take us under two minutes key hey Clark
83:58
and then relegated to the bench as Tony
84:00
Bennett has decided to go big often in
84:03
this game Dalton the Akita together on
84:05
the floor
84:06
the bigs would Perdue on staying too
84:08
long on the pick-and-roll harm must show
84:10
and get right back because they're
84:11
passed Lee to the big guy who just
84:13
simple hands up that's an offensive foul
84:15
oh no whistled Bob Ross he was ready to
84:18
blow the whistle
84:21
I thought he was going to call it he
84:22
didn't that was a blatant - hand push
84:24
off give me space on dissa file I do not
84:27
see how all three four officials missed
84:30
that call at the top of the key
84:31
it looked like he was ready to put the
84:33
air in it but he never dead 15 offensive
84:36
rebounds for Virginia
84:38
[Applause]
84:41
this is an eternity on this side of the
84:43
floor defensively for Purdue's Jerome
84:45
steady and it's topped by Eastern
84:47
partisan we're doing down the point
84:49
then at 23 lakhs with your Virginia get
84:53
to that pack line because Edwards is
84:54
coming and if you double-team look for
84:57
the ultimate time out Matt painter and
85:01
that painter gets off a shot for the
85:03
official saying that was a foul
85:06
couple of no cause here he didn't get
85:08
that me smack the backboard and here
85:11
this is a file anywhere catch a breath
85:18
you
85:21
that's a game reset Purdue has the ball
85:24
down a point two timeouts left Virginia
85:27
has one timeout remaining both teams in
85:30
the 1 and 1 in the bonus and on a held
85:33
ball possession arrow belongs to Purdue
85:36
watch that was attacking but Virginia
85:39
may double-team him the bigs have to be
85:42
ready to slip the pick-and-roll right
85:43
away and have their hands ready to catch
85:45
his Edwards for the leap
85:47
[Applause]
85:51
they're doing 10:32 as Edwards
85:59
you have to go to the bank anymore he
86:01
doesn't have to : that that's good but
86:03
now you have to lock down and watch the
86:05
guy who's room in the bench language
86:06
another one again trip to the final four
86:10
here's guy comes up short
86:14
did he step on the face side
86:25
the moon sometimes you have to be lucky
86:27
but when you tend to seventeen threes it
86:31
is good that was for 40 points but
86:34
Carson Edwards here
86:36
look at the effort Oh didn't not touch
86:40
the line no yes he did yeah at the end a
86:43
great job with the official who trapped
86:45

86:48
the good the great call and no review
86:49
either confident in the call they play
86:52
on Purdue of the basketball down to
86:56
watch for the slip in the pick-and-roll
86:58
corks Edwards wants it but he wants to
87:00
be smart he needs to let them get to the
87:02
big guy off the double team can be the
87:03
game right here here's Emmett's victory

old box out stock or a key Cordia key
88:38
tank for the rest of the players trying
88:40
to go for the rebound on the septic

88:49
Virginia has dominated the offensive
88:52
glass
88:52

88:58

94:59
original call was on tied to Rome they
95:02
have changed it to DeAndre hunter that's
95:05
big would have been the forethought
95:07
Jerome but hunter gets the foul no jelly
95:10
circles at the line for two
95:14
[Applause]
95:20
Matt painter is going to bring on his

95:32
tonight Eastern together look too wide
95:35
lead no one out of two detail at the
95:38
board Virginia can take the lead here
95:42
we go under two minutes of this first
95:44
overtime
95:47
p-wave battle

96:24
nine that does not tell the story five
96:26
to six as we have the one and one what
96:28
does tell the story was his first half
96:30
and second half because Saturday 90%
96:33
free-throw shooter
96:35
is the first one all tied at 73 now is
96:39
the freshman Aaron wheeler enters for
96:42
Eastern Matt painter going offense for
96:45
defense with Eastern going out you
96:47
losing a lot of muscle which is still
96:49
gaining that athletic ability with

wheeler do now will be on the wing you
96:53
see the big fella knock down the free
96:55
throw watch free throws for the andre
96:58
hunter
96:59
[Applause]
97:01
forcing the issue
97:05
let's draw - don't take the quick shot
97:07
little hat - Edward little mid-range the
97:10
icky take tapped America
97:12
for Virginia now the Hoos have the lead
97:15
minute 23 left in the first overtime
97:19
this is what I love
97:21
the team's leader he's settling down the
97:23
opposite team given in other guys hands
97:25
but you have to watch him he's so sneaky
97:27
booth this is when he usually shows up
97:30
with the big play that she wouldn't
97:31
expect great ball handlers on the floor
97:34
for Virginia
97:35
here is hunter only pass it up now on
97:38
the taken Edwards and it's off of Hunter
97:41
Edwards got a hand on it last touched by
97:44
hunter Perdue ball harm has been helping
97:50
everyone on the defensive end tonight
97:52
he got a little help from the guard
97:53
stick two handed off the knee
97:55
Purdue's ball
97:59
under a minute to go overtime number one
98:02
the foul trouble that exists
98:04
they got treyvion Williams with four and
98:07
the three Cavaliers with three and so
98:12
Tony Bennett and Matt painter boats have
98:16
employed different strategies here
98:19
tonight than we've seen from these two
98:22
teams throughout the course of the year
98:23
both going big with two of their big men
98:26
on the floor Williams and harms for
98:28
Purdue and in salt and D a key chain for
98:32
Virginia
98:32
[Music]
98:38
the official Rock groomer just came over
98:39
they're going to add point three to the
98:42
clock so it'll be one minute exactly and
98:45
Purdue at the basketball down a point
98:48
for Purdue this isn't the lineup that
98:51
got him back in the game - again past
98:53
the battle with the player that may be
98:56
bigger than him but hunter in the game
98:58
let's see a Purdue can get inside with
99:00
the deepest of Virginia this is what
99:01
they usually make a stable Edwards
99:04
picked up his dribble hits it right back
99:08
now Edwards on the take Edwards gets in
99:10
the lane
99:11
[Applause]
99:12
[Music]
99:17
to make a defensive stain
99:20
efforts pass the ball if you steal that
99:22
- watch out for - Roman guy begin the
99:24
rebound is a deity take and hunters
99:26
inside of the office support undergoes
99:28
to work on I for powers his way Dre
99:32
hunter and Virginia now in the lead shot
99:36
clock is off Matt painter with a timeout
99:39
Wow two stellar drives to the basket by
99:47
the two top scorers
99:51
Edwards now with 42 points and the Andre
99:56
hunter he's been quiet but two big ones
99:59
right there puts him in the double
100:01
digits if hunter had not been playing
100:04
deepest the way he has all night his
100:06
team would not be in this position
100:08
he was quiet offensively but he's been
100:11
the mainstay he had the icky tape for
100:13
the Virginia defense that was Virginia
100:15
who called that timeout they're down to
100:18
their last what a game I mean this is
100:20
something else for a trip to the Final
100:22
Four
100:22
talk us through a little strategy here
100:24
if you're the Boilermakers well
100:25
obviously you want a great shot you have
100:27
26 seconds on the clock Edwards you know
100:29
you wanted this in his hands he has
100:31
climbed but also look for the slip of
100:33
the big fella because they're gonna
100:35
double-team it and take it out of the
100:36
guards hands
100:40
[Applause]
100:42
Virginia with one timeout remaining
100:45
Perdue has two left again if there's a
100:48
held ball at possession arrow now
100:50
belongs to Virginia Carson Edwards with
100:55
42 points he went for 42 against
100:57
Villanova in the second round 10 made
101:01
threes if you're Virginia no reaching in
101:05
no silly fouls at dear Clark on Edwards
101:08
you know that Everest is going to attack
101:10
he trusts the second line of defense
101:12
this right now is when you can play the
101:14
perimeters and let your pack defense
101:17
that blue line that we talked about
101:18
before the game take place three-point
101:21
shooters all around Matt harms his
101:23
Edwards is on the triple with Clark
101:26
right with him the a--quite a there
101:29
game clock down to 11 to 10 Edwards step
101:32
back
101:33
Sir Ian something no good and they get
101:38
it it's a foul if they get the timeout
101:45
first or is the foul call that's big
101:47
because it could be free-throws it's not
101:49
[Music]
101:52
over genuine the lead and it is a foul
101:56
and two shots coming for Kyle guy I
102:00
would say that's a tough shot but he's
102:02
been knocking them down all night and
102:05
look at Virginia they haven't really
102:08
smallest guys on the court getting the
102:10
rebound doing it by committee puts him
102:13
up two boys clutch free throws almost
102:17
too much to take
102:19
[Applause]
102:24
three point Virginia lead is Kyle guy
102:27
delivers big free throws in the clutch
102:31
5.7 left Purdue
102:34
down three as Virginia uses their final
102:38
timeout
102:45
[Music]
102:47
I'll guy with 25 points rolled his ankle
102:52
late in the first half Virginia last
102:57
time they were in the final for 1984
103:02
been a long time for the Cavaliers as
103:06
great as they have been they were a 17
103:10
old and holidays Ricky Stokes they won
103:12
the East Regional ended up losing to
103:15
Houston in Seattle Tony Bennett 5.7
103:23
seconds away but Perdue with the ball
103:27
makes it in substitutions this is when
103:29
you can go straight off it's for defense
103:32
again and five Carson Edwards I do want
103:35
to take the shot but I have to
103:36
understand our maybe double team and I
103:38
need to talk to whoever sets the screen
103:40
for me telling them to slip this is how
103:44
we got to overtime
103:45
scurry after a missed free-throw ended
103:48
up in the hands of the akiti a chase
103:50
down by Kihei Clark a bullet pass and
103:53
the quick release by the junior from
103:56
Guinea and that tied it it looked like
104:00
Purdue had it in the grasp
104:04
they were up three they found Jerome and
104:07
somehow Virginia got it square here we
104:09
go right here watch the baseball pass to
104:12
a big guy or Carson that was on the
104:14
wrong Garcia that works looking at the
104:16
clock pass and it's turned over with
104:21
the remaining and now Virginia can put
104:27
this one away
104:31
for a game as brilliant as this it could
104:35
end on a turnover they're gonna take a
104:39
look at the clock here when Edwards has
104:43
to be sick he was looking for Kline and
104:51
that could be Purdue season that was a
104:54
tough play called they're expecting
104:56
Emperor's to dribble up toward half in
104:59
the maker and almost a half court pass
105:01
right there with the defense of Virginia
105:03
I think maybe it would have been better
105:08
to get it to the big fella
105:10
and hitting Carson it was on the run so
105:12
the big fella could set his screams on
105:15
the dribble handoff while he's getting
105:17
the ball to Edwards
105:19
[Applause]
105:23
where the agony of the Boilermaker fans
105:25
they thought they had it what a rally by
105:29
Virginia Purdue now takes a timeout when
105:35
that painter will extend it
105:38
best defensive team in the country for
105:41
some years they embraced the moment of
105:45
defense it's much harder this score and
105:47
it is to get us stopped many times with
105:49
this team this Virginia team they knew
105:51
what they were doing they were very
105:52
confident on that last leg of a grant
105:53
and got to get the ball in bounds and
105:55
then I'm just certainly going to be a
105:57
foul got to make your free throws in
105:59
Virginia hit make that trip to the Final
106:01
Four
106:01
yeah and if you want to look back to
106:03
Purdue right before all the time that
106:04
they would have made that free throw
106:06
definitely would have sealed the game
106:07
but again the icky tape he had different
106:10
plans so they did add some time to the
106:14
clock 2.1 remaining in this overtime
106:20

give all the credit to you Kyle all the
109:30
credit to the players that's what Coach
109:31
it's all about what was the feeling like
109:34
when you were huddled up with your team
109:35
when it became a two-possession game
109:37
with the one second on the clock man
109:39
we're just so happy we've worked so hard
109:40
for this and we've come from from so far
109:44
the way last year ended everyone
109:46
probably counted us out but man I'm so
109:48
proud of our guys and our coaching staff
109:50
and our beautiful fans I can't I can't
109:52
even put into words what this means you
109:54
were huge tonight with 25 points you
109:56
couldn't hit a three this whole
109:58
tournament then you get hurt and
109:59
halftime and you come out and you drain
110:01
three three-pointers how did you
110:02
overcome it all mentally with my face my
110:05
faith in the Lord and my team I told
110:08
everybody down believe in slumps and
110:10
that's a bad word in my household
110:11
because I always feel in rhythm and when
110:13
when my guys are trying to find me with
110:14
that much confidence in me it's hard not
110:16
to not to bang a few so what do you want
